### General Info
***
A desktop application that allows you to study Valencian literature while having fun and playing! 
It has a memory cards gamemode to pair cards that contain an author's name and a random fact about some author, when you pair the cards correctly, they disappear. 
You can press the "Reinicialitzar" button to reset the cards and keep playing.
Everytime you press that button or you open the memory cards game again, the window is filled another random authors and facts in a different order.
There's also a gamemode called FlashCards where you can see authors with their birth date and when pressing on an author, 
a window will appear with the most important information about the author.
