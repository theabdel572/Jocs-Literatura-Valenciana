### General Info

A desktop application that allows you to study Valencian literature while having fun and playing! 
It has a memory cards gamemode to pair cards that contain an author's name and a random fact about some author, when you pair the cards correctly, they disappear. 
You can press the "Reset" button to reset the cards and keep playing. 
There's also a gamemode called FlashCards where you can see authors with their birth date and when pressing on an author, 
a window will appear with the most important information about the author.
